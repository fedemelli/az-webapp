IP flow verify then tests the communication and informs you if the connection succeeds or fails. If the connection fails, IP flow verify tells you which security rule allowed or denied the communication, so that you can resolve the problem. B: The connection troubleshoot capability enables you to test a connection between a VM and another VM, an FQDN, a URI, or an IPv4 address. The test returns similar information returned when using the connection monitor capability, but tests the connection at a point in time, rather than monitoring it over time, as connection monitor does.

Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point. Answer: Explanation: Box 1: No Subscription1 is a member of ManagementGroup21, ManagementGroup21 is a member of ManagementGroup11, ManagementGroup11 is a member of the Tenant Root Group, The Tenant Root group has ‘Not allowed resource types for virtual network’. Box 2: No: You cannot create a VM, because based on the Policy you can only create VNETs in Sybscription2 (ManagementGroup12). Box 3: No You cannot ADD Subscription1 to ManagementGroup11, but you can MOVE Subscription1 from ManagementGroup21 to ManagmentGroup11. Subscriptions can only be a member of ONE ManagementGroup at a time. Allowed Resource Type (Deny): Defines the resource types that you can deploy. Its effect is to deny all resources that aren't part of this defined list. Not allowed resource types (Deny): Prevents a list of resource types from being deployed. Based on the Policies, VNETs are not allowed in the Tenant Root Group scope, so you cannot deploy VNETs. Also, VNETs only allowed in ManagementGroup12 scope, but you cannot deploy any other resource.

You set the registration virtual network to VNet2. The adatum.com zone is configured as shown in the following exhibit: For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point. Answer: Explanation: Box 1: No Azure DNS provides automatic registration of virtual machines from a single virtual network that's linked to a private zone as a registration virtual network. VM5 does not belong to the registration virtual network though. Box 2: No Forward DNS resolution is supported across virtual networks that are linked to the private zone as resolution virtual networks. VM5 does belong to a resolution virtual network. Box 3: Yes VM6 belongs to registration virtual network, and an A (Host) record exists for VM9 in the DNS zone. By default, registration virtual networks also act as resolution virtual networks, in the sense that DNS resolution against the zone works from any of the virtual machines within the registration virtual network. Reference: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/private-dns-overview QUESTION 53 Hotspot Question You have an Azure subscription that contains a virtual network named VNet1. VNet1 uses an IP address space of 10.0.0.0/16 and contains the subnets in the following table: Subnet1 contains a virtual appliance named VM1 that operates as a router. You create a routing table named RT1. You need to route all inbound traffic from the VPN gateway to VNet1 through VM1. How should you configure RT1? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point. Answer: QUESTION 54 Hotspot Question You have an Azure subscription that contains the virtual machines shown in the following table: VM1 and VM2 use public IP addresses. From Windows Server 2019 on VM1 and VM2, you allow inbound Remote Desktop connections. Subnet1 and Subnet2 are in a virtual network named VNET1. The subscription contains two network security groups (NSGs) named NSG1 and NSG2. NSG1 uses only the default rules. NSG2 uses the default rules and the following custom incoming rule: Priority: 100 Name: Rule1 - Port: 3389 Protocol: TCP Source: Any Destination: Any Action: Allow NSG1 is associated to Subnet1. NSG2 is associated to the network interface of VM2. For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point. Answer: Explanation: VM1-NSG1 is using only the default inbound and outbound rules, which does not include port 3389. QUESTION 55 Hotspot Question You have a virtual network named VNET1 that contains the subnets shown in the following table: You have two Azure virtual machines that have the network configurations shown in the following table: For NSG1, you create the inbound security rule shown in the following table: For NSG2, you create the inbound security rule shown in the following table: For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point. Answer: Explanation: Box 1: Yes The inbound security rule for NSG1 allows TCP port 1433 from 10.10.2.0/24 (or Subnet2 where VM2 and VM3 are located) to 10.10.1.0/24 (or Subnet1 where VM1 is located) while the inbound security rule for NSG2 blocks TCP port 1433 from 10.10.2.5 (or VM2) to 10.10.1.5 (or VM1). However, the NSG1 rule has a higher priority (or lower value) than the NSG2 rule. Box 2: Yes No rule explicitly blocks communication from VM1. The default rules, which allow communication, are thus applied. Box 3: Yes No rule explicitly blocks communication between VM2 and VM3 which are both on Subnet2. The default rules, which allow communication, are thus applied. Reference: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/security-overview QUESTION 56 Hotspot Question You have an Azure subscription named Subscription1. Subscription1 contains the virtual machines in the following table: Subscription1 contains a virtual network named VNet1 that has the subnets in the following table: VM3 has multiple network adapters, including a network adapter named NIC3. IP forwarding is enabled on NIC3. Routing is enabled on VM3. You create a route table named RT1 that contains the routes in the following table: You apply RT1 to Subnet1 and Subnet2. For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point. Answer: Explanation: IP forwarding enables the virtual machine a network interface is attached to: Receive network traffic not destined for one of the IP addresses assigned to any of the IP configurations assigned to the network interface. Send network traffic with a different source IP address than the one assigned to one of a network interface's IP configurations. The setting must be enabled for every network interface that is attached to the virtual machine that receives traffic that the virtual machine needs to forward. A virtual machine can forward traffic whether it has multiple network interfaces or a single network interface attached to it. Box 1: Yes The routing table allows connections from VM3 to VM1 and VM2. And as IP forwarding is enabled on VM3, VM3 can connect to VM1. Box 2: No VM3, which has IP forwarding, must be turned on, in order for VM2 to connect to VM1. Box 3: Yes The routing table allows connections from VM1 and VM2 to VM3. IP forwarding on VM3 allows VM1 to connect to VM2 via VM3. Reference: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview QUESTION 57 Hotspot Question You create a Recovery Services vault backup policy named Policy1 as shown in the following exhibit: Use the drop-down menus to select the answer choice that completes each statement based on the information presented in the graphic. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point. Answer: Explanation: Box 1: 10 years The yearly backup point occurs to 1 March and its retention period is 10 years. Box 2: 36 months The monthly backup point occurs on the 1st of every month and its retention period is 36 months. QUESTION 58 You have an Azure subscription that contains 10 virtual machines.

When connecting VNets from different subscriptions, the subscriptions do not need to be associated with the same Active Directory tenant. Configuring a VNet-to-VNet connection is a good way to easily connect VNets. Connecting a virtual network to another virtual network using the VNet-to-VNet connection type (VNet2VNet) is similar to creating a Site-to-Site IPsec connection to an on-premises location. Both connectivity types use a VPN gateway to provide a secure tunnel using IPsec/IKE, and both function the same way when communicating. The local network gateway for each VNet treats the other VNet as a local site. This lets you specify additional address space for the local network gateway in order to route traffic.

Azure Key Vault provides a mechanism to store secrets, such as storage account keys, user credentials, and digital certificates, securely in the Microsoft Azure cloud. You can access the underlying Representational State Transfer (REST) application programming interface (API) to rotate or retrieve the secrets in your source code. You should not enable SSE on the storage account for two reasons. First, SSE is enabled automatically on all Azure storage accounts and encrypts all storage account data at rest. Second, SSE in its native form uses Microsoft-managed access keys, which violates the scenario constraint for customer-managed keys. You should not require secure transfer for the storage account. Secure transfer forces all REST API calls to use HTTPS instead of HTTP. This feature has nothing to do with either access keys or their management and rotation.

    "explanation": "You should configure peering between prod-vnet-west and prod-vnet-west. Peering enables VMs located on two different Azure VNets to be grouped logically together and thereby connect and share resources. Traditional VNet peering involves two VNets located in the same region. However, global VNet peering, generally available in summer 2018, supports VNets distributed across any Azure public region. You should not deploy a VNet-to-VNet VPN. First, global VNet peering means that you are no longer required to use a VPN gateway to link VNets located in different Azure regions. Second, the scenario requires that you minimize cost and complexity. You should not create a private zone in Azure DNS. This action would be necessary for resources in peered VNets to resolve each other's DNS host names. However, the scenario makes no requirement for private host name resolution. You should not add a service endpoint to each VNet. Service endpoints allow you to limit access to certain Azure resources, such as storage accounts and Azure SQL databases, to resources located on a single VNet.

    "explanation": "You should add a Domain Name System (DNS) verification record at the domain registrar. This step is required to verify to Microsoft that you own the public DNS domain name in question. You perform the validation by creating either a text (TXT) or mail exchanger (MX) record in your DNS zone file at the registrar's website, using Microsoft-provided values. You can delete the verification record after Azure validates the domain for use with Azure AD. You should not remove the companycom.onmicrosoft.com domain name from the Azure AD tenant. In fact, you cannot remove this domain name because Azure uses it to identify your directory uniquely across the entire Microsoft Azure global ecosystem. You should not add a company.com user principal name (UPN) suffix to the AD DS domain. If you use a non-routable DNS domain in AD DS, then you may indeed be required to perform this action. However, the scenario does not specify what AD DS domain name is currently defined. You should not run Azure AD Connect from a domain member server and specify the custom installation option. Configuring the proper public and private DNS domain names is one of the prerequisite steps that needs to be completed before you run the Azure AD Connect wizard for the first time."

To answer, move all actions from the list of actions to the answer area and arrange them in the correct order. NOTE: More than one order of answer choices is correct. You will receive credit for any of the correct orders you select. Answer: Explanation: At a high level, an import job involves the following steps: Step 1: Attach an external disk to Server1 and then run waimportexport.exe Determine data to be imported, number of drives you need, destination blob location for your data in Azure storage. Use the WAImportExport tool to copy data to disk drives. Encrypt the disk drives with BitLocker. Step 2: From the Azure portal, create an import job.

Which virtual machines can you migrate? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point. Answer: Explanation: Box 1: VM3 Not VM1 as Bitlocker is not supported. BitLocker must be disabled before you enable replication for a VM. Not VM2 as maximum Operating system disk size for a generation VM is 2,048 GB. Box 2: VMA and VMB only Not VMC as the max data disk size is 4,095 GB References: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/hyper-v-azure-support-matrix https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/vmware-physical-azure-support- matrix#azure-vm-requirements QUESTION 135 Drag and Drop Question Your network is configured as shown in the following exhibit. The firewalls are configured as shown in the following table. Prod1 contains a vCenter server. You install an Azure Migrate Collector on Test1. You need to discover the virtual machines. Which TCP port should be allowed on each firewall? To answer, drag the appropriate ports to the correct firewalls. Each port may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point. Answer: Explanation: FW1: Outbound 443 Collector communicates with Azure Migrate service over SSL 443. FW2: Outbound 443 The Collector must be able to communicate with the vCenter Server. By default, it connects to vCenter on 443. Note: The collector communicates as summarized in the following diagram. References: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/concepts-collector QUESTION 136 Drag and Drop Question You have an on-premises network that includes a Microsoft SQL Server instance named SQL1. You create an Azure Logic App named App1. You need to ensure that App1 can query a database on SQL1. Which three actions should you perform in sequence? To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list of actions to the answer area and arrange them in the correct order. Answer: Explanation: To access data sources on premises from your logic apps, you can create a data gateway resource in Azure so that your logic apps can use the on-premises connectors. Box 1: From an on-premises computer, install an on-premises data gateway. Before you can connect to on- premises data sources from Azure Logic Apps, download and install the on-premises data gateway on a local computer. Box 2: From the Azure portal, create an on-premises data gateway Create Azure resource for gateway After you install the gateway on a local computer, you can then create an Azure resource for your gateway. This step also associates your gateway resource with your Azure subscription. Sign in to the Azure portal. Make sure you use the same Azure work or school email address used to install the gateway. On the main Azure menu, select Create a resource > Integration > On-premises data gateway. On the Create connection gateway page, provide this information for your gateway resource. To add the gateway resource to your Azure dashboard, select Pin to dashboard. When you're done, choose Create. Box 3: From the Logic Apps Designer in the Azure portal, add a connector After you create your gateway resource and associate your Azure subscription with this resource, you can now create a connection between your logic app and your on-premises data source by using the gateway. In the Azure portal, create or open your logic app in the Logic App Designer. Add a connector that supports on-premises connections, for example, SQL Server. Set up your connection.

    "question": "Hotspot Question You plan to use Azure Network Watcher to perform the following tasks: Task1: Identify a security rule that prevents a network packet from reaching an Azure virtual machine. Task2: Validate outbound connectivity from an Azure virtual machine to an external host. Which feature should you use for each task? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point. Answer: Explanation: Task 1: IP flow verify IP flow verify checks if a packet is allowed or denied to or from a virtual machine. The information consists of direction, protocol, local IP, remote IP, local port, and remote port. If the packet is denied by a security group, the name of the rule that denied the packet is returned. While any source or destination IP can be chosen, IP flow verify helps administrators quickly diagnose connectivity issues from or to the internet and from or to the on-premises environment. Task 2: With the addition of Connection Troubleshoot, Network Watcher will see an incremental increase in its capabilities and ways for you to utilize it in your day to day operations. You can now, for example, check connectivity between source (VM) and destination (VM, URI, FQDN, IP Address).

You can move a NIC to a different RG or Subscription by selecting (change) next to the RG or Subscription name. If you move the NIC to a new Subscription, you must move all resources related to the NIC with it. If the network interface is attached to a virtual machine, for example, you must also move the virtual machine, and other virtual machine-related resources. Box 3: No You can move IP2 to RG1, as it isn't associated with any other resource, however it stayed in the East US region. The location will not change. Note: Resources can be everywhere regardless of the resource group they belong to. The resource group is only a collection of metadata relative to the resources defined inside it. You can move a resource from one resource group to another group. The resources in a resource group can be located in different regions than the resource group.

Incorrect Answers: A, not C: Live migration is supported only for storage accounts that use LRS replication. If your account uses GRS or RA-GRS, then you need to first change your account's replication type to LRS before proceeding. This intermediary step removes the secondary endpoint provided by GRS/RA-GRS. Also, only standard storage account types support live migration. Premium storage accounts must be migrated manually.

Answer: Explanation: The total regional vCPUs is 20 so that means a maximum total of 20 vCPUs across all the different VM sizes. The deallocated VM with 16 vCPUs counts towards the total. VM20 and VM1 are using 18 of the maximum 20 vCPUs leaving only two vCPUs available. Reference: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/quotas QUESTION 260 Hotspot Question You have an Azure subscription that contains an Azure Availability Set named WEBPROD-AS- USE2 as shown in the following exhibit. You add 14 virtual machines to WEBPROD-AS-USE2. Use the drop-down menus to select the answer choice that completes each statement based on the information presented in the graphic. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point. Answer: Explanation: Box 1: 2 There are 10 update domains. The 14 VMs are shared across the 10 update domains so four update domains will have two VMs and six update domains will have one VM. Only one update domain is rebooted at a time. Therefore, a maximum of two VMs will be offline. Box 2: 7 There are 2 fault domains. The 14 VMs are shared across the 2 fault domains, so 7 VMs in each fault domain. A rack failure will affect one fault domain so 7 VMs will be offline.

You create the budget shown in the following exhibit. The AG1 action group contains a user named admin@contoso.com only. Use the drop-down menus to select the answer choice that completes each statement based on the information presented in the graphic. Answer: Explanation: Box 1: VM1 is turned off, and VM2 continues to run The budget alerts are for Resource Group RG1, which include VM1, but not VM2. Box 2: one email notification will be sent each month. Budget alerts for Resource Group RG1, which include VM1, but not VM2.VM1 consumes 20 Euro/day. The 50%, 500 Euro limit, will be reached in 25 days, and an email will be sent. The 70% and 100% alert conditions will not be reached within a month, and they don't trigger email actions anyway. Credit alerts: Credit alerts are generated automatically at 90% and at 100% of your Azure credit balance. Whenever an alert is generated, it's reflected in cost alerts and in the email sent to the account owners. 90% and 100% will not be reached though.

General-purpose v2 (GPv2) accounts are storage accounts that support all of the latest features for blobs, files, queues, and tables. Blob storage accounts support all the same block blob features as GPv2, but are limited to supporting only block blobs. General-purpose v1 (GPv1) accounts provide access to all Azure Storage services, but may not have the latest features or the lowest per gigabyte pricing.

Answer: Explanation: Box 1: StorageV2 You may only tier your object storage data to hot, cool, or archive in Blob storage and General Purpose v2 (GPv2) accounts. General Purpose v1 (GPv1) accounts do not support tiering. General-purpose v2 accounts deliver the lowest per-gigabyte capacity prices for Azure Storage, as well as industry-competitive transaction prices. Box 2: Standard_GRS Geo-redundant storage (GRS): Cross-regional replication to protect against region-wide unavailability. Incorrect Answers: Locally-redundant storage (LRS): A simple, low-cost replication strategy. Data is replicated within a single storage scale unit. Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS): Cross-regional replication with read access to the replica. RA-GRS provides read-only access to the data in the secondary location, in addition to geo-replication across two regions, but is more expensive compared to GRS.

Only deployments are. Not quite true though. So also tested the policy myself and the outcome was the following: Started VM stayed on, was able to stop and start again. Could not create Vnet or VM. Could not change VM size. Could not change the address space. Could move Vnet and VM. So basically the correct answer is Yes - No - No QUESTION 301 Drag and Drop Question You have an Azure subscription that contains a storage account.

In which order should you perform the actions? To answer, move all actions from the list of actions to the answer area and arrange them in the correct order. NOTE: More than one order of answer choices is correct. You will receive credit for any of the correct orders you select. Answer: Explanation: At a high level, an import job involves the following steps: Step 1: Attach an external disk to Server1 and then run waimportexport.exe Determine data to be imported, number of drives you need, destination blob location for your data in Azure storage. Use the WAImportExport tool to copy data to disk drives. Encrypt the disk drives with BitLocker. Step 2: From the Azure portal, create an import job. Create an import job in your target storage account in Azure portal. Upload the drive journal files. Step 3: Detach the external disks from Server1 and ship the disks to an Azure data center. Provide the return address and carrier account number for shipping the drives back to you. Ship the disk drives to the shipping address provided during job creation. Step 4: From the Azure portal, update the import job Update the delivery tracking number in the import job details and submit the import job. The drives are received and processed at the Azure data center. The drives are shipped using your carrier account to the return address provided in the import job.

Subscription1 contains the resources in the following table. VNet1 is in RG1. VNet2 is in RG2. There is no connectivity between VNet1 and VNet2. An administrator named Admin1 creates an Azure virtual machine named VM1 in RG1. VM1 uses a disk named Disk1 and connects to VNet1. Admin1 then installs a custom application in VM1. You need to move the custom application to VNet2. The solution must minimize administrative effort. Which two actions should you perform? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point. Answer: Explanation: We cannot just move a virtual machine between networks. What we need to do is identify the disk used by the VM, delete the VM itself while retaining the disk, and recreate the VM in the target virtual network and then attach the original disk to it.

When connecting VNets from different subscriptions, the subscriptions do not need to be associated with the same Active Directory tenant. Configuring a VNet-to-VNet connection is a good way to easily connect VNets. Connecting a virtual network to another virtual network using the VNet-to-VNet connection type (VNet2VNet) is similar to creating a Site-to-Site IPsec connection to an on-premises location. Both connectivity types use a VPN gateway to provide a secure tunnel using IPsec/IKE, and both function the same way when communicating. The local network gateway for each VNet treats the other VNet as a local site. This lets you specify additional address space for the local network gateway in order to route traffic.

    "question": "Case Study 2 - Contoso, Ltd Overview Contoso, Ltd. is a manufacturing company that has offices worldwide. Contoso works with partner organizations to bring products to market. Contoso products are manufactured by using blueprint files that the company authors and maintains. Existing Environment Currently, Contoso uses multiple types of servers for business operations, including the following: File servers Domain controllers Microsoft SQL Server servers Your network contains an Active Directory forest named contoso.com. All servers and client computers are joined to Active Directory. You have a public-facing application named App1. App1 is comprised of the following three tiers: A SQL database A web front end A processing middle tier Each tier is comprised of five virtual machines. Users access the web front end by using HTTPS only. Requirements Planned Changes Contoso plans to implement the following changes to the infrastructure: Move all the tiers of App1 to Azure. Move the existing product blueprint files to Azure Blob storage. Create a hybrid directory to support an upcoming Microsoft Office 365 migration project. Technical Requirements Contoso must meet the following technical requirements: Move all the virtual machines for App1 to Azure. Minimize the number of open ports between the App1 tiers. Ensure that all the virtual machines for App1 are protected by backups. Copy the blueprint files to Azure over the Internet. Ensure that the blueprint files are stored in the archive storage tier. Ensure that partner access to the blueprint files is secured and temporary. Prevent user passwords or hashes of passwords from being stored in Azure. Use unmanaged standard storage for the hard disks of the virtualmachines. Ensure that when users join devices to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), the users use a mobile phone to verify their identity. Minimize administrative effort whenever possible. User Requirements Contoso identifies the following requirements for users: Ensure that only users who are part of a group named Pilot can join devices to Azure AD. Designate a new user named Admin1 as the service administrator of the Azure subscription. Ensure that a new user named User3 can create network objects for the Azure subscription.

You will receive credit for any of the correct orders you select. Answer: QUESTION 354 Hotspot Question You have an Azure subscription that contains the resources shown in the following table. VMSS1 is set to VM (virtual machines) orchestration mode. You need to deploy a new Azure virtual machine named VM1, and then add VM1 to VMSS1. Which resource group and location should you use to deploy VM1? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point. Answer: Explanation: Box 1: RG1, RG2, or RG3 The resource group stores metadata about the resources. When you specify a location for the resource group, you're specifying where that metadata is stored. The location of the RG doesn't influence the choice of the location of VM. best practice would be to create the VM1 in the RG1 because the scale set is in RG1. And Microsoft recommends that resources contained in a Resource Group share the same resource lifecycle. Box 2: West US only You can add the virtual machine to a scale set in the same region, zone, and resource group.

It provides the following: Unified migration platform: A single portal to start, run, and track your migration to Azure. Range of tools: A range of tools for assessment and migration. Azure Migrate tools include Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment and Azure Migrate: Server Migration. Azure Migrate also integrates with other Azure services and tools, and with independent software vendor (ISV) offerings. Assessment and migration: In the Azure Migrate hub, you can assess and migrate: Servers, databases, and web apps: Assess on-premises servers including web apps and SQL Server instances and migrate them to Azure virtual machines or Azure VMware Solution (AVS) (Preview). Databases: Assess on-premises databases and migrate them to Azure SQL Database or to SQL Managed Instance. Web applications: Assess on-premises web applications and migrate them to Azure App Service. Virtual desktops: Assess your on-premises virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) and migrate it to Windows Virtual Desktop in Azure. Data: Migrate large amounts of data to Azure quickly and cost-effectively using Azure Data Box products. Based on this information let's analyze each option: NYC-FS01 : Its role \"Server\" fall under above categories. Hence it can be accessed by using Azure migrate. BOS-DB01 : Its role \"server\" fall under above categories. Hence it can be accessed by using Azure migrate. Sea-CA01 : Its role \"CA\" does not fall under above categories.

Use 20 for platformUpdateDomainCount Increasing the update domain (platformUpdateDomainCount) helps with capacity and availability planning when the platform reboots nodes. A higher number for the pool (20 is max) means that fewer of their nodes in any given availability set would be rebooted at once.

    "question": "Case Study 2 - Contoso, Ltd Overview Contoso, Ltd. is a manufacturing company that has offices worldwide. Contoso works with partner organizations to bring products to market. Contoso products are manufactured by using blueprint files that the company authors and maintains. Existing Environment Currently, Contoso uses multiple types of servers for business operations, including the following: File servers Domain controllers Microsoft SQL Server servers Your network contains an Active Directory forest named contoso.com. All servers and client computers are joined to Active Directory. You have a public-facing application named App1. App1 is comprised of the following three tiers: A SQL database A web front end A processing middle tier Each tier is comprised of five virtual machines. Users access the web front end by using HTTPS only. Requirements Planned Changes Contoso plans to implement the following changes to the infrastructure: Move all the tiers of App1 to Azure. Move the existing product blueprint files to Azure Blob storage. Create a hybrid directory to support an upcoming Microsoft Office 365 migration project. Technical Requirements Contoso must meet the following technical requirements: Move all the virtual machines for App1 to Azure. Minimize the number of open ports between the App1 tiers. Ensure that all the virtual machines for App1 are protected by backups. Copy the blueprint files to Azure over the Internet. Ensure that the blueprint files are stored in the archive storage tier. Ensure that partner access to the blueprint files is secured and temporary. Prevent user passwords or hashes of passwords from being stored in Azure. Use unmanaged standard storage for the hard disks of the virtualmachines. Ensure that when users join devices to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), the users use a mobile phone to verify their identity. Minimize administrative effort whenever possible. User Requirements Contoso identifies the following requirements for users: Ensure that only users who are part of a group named Pilot can join devices to Azure AD. Designate a new user named Admin1 as the service administrator of the Azure subscription. Ensure that a new user named User3 can create network objects for the Azure subscription. You are planning the move of App1 to Azure. You create a network security group (NSG). You need to recommend a solution to provide users with access to App1. What should you recommend?",

Answer: Explanation: Box 1: 10.244.0.0/16 The Pod CIDR. Note: The --pod-cidr should be a large address space that isn't in use elsewhere in your network environment. This range includes any on-premises network ranges if you connect, or plan to connect, your Azure virtual networks using Express Route or a Site-to-Site VPN connection. This address range must be large enough to accommodate the number of nodes that you expect to scale up to. You can't change this address range once the cluster is deployed if you need more addresses for additional nodes. Box 2: 10.0.0.0/16 The --service-cidr is used to assign internal services in the AKS cluster an IP address.

The scale-in settings for the App Service plan are configured as shown in the following exhibit. The scale out rule is configured with the same duration and cool down tile as the scale in rule. Use the drop-down menus to select the answer choice that completes each statement based on the information presented in the graphic. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point. Answer: Explanation: Box 1: 2 70% for 1h, and then 90% for 5 minutes. So, from the default of 1 it will scale out out 1 more. So, 2 in total. Box 2: 4 90% for 1h and then 25% for 9minutes. So, from the default of 1 it will it scale in to the max 5 (60/5 = 12, which means 6 times scale out, because we have 5 minutes period of cool down). Then when it drops to 25% for 9 minutes and it will scale in once after 5 mins (since the average of the last 5 minutes is under 30% ), so it will decrease by 1, so 4 in total. Then it will have a cooldown of 5 minutes before scaling in again, but since only 4 minutes left from 9 minutes (9-5 = 4), it won't scale in again. So, 4 in total.

Rule1 is configured as shown in the Rule1 exhibit. (Click the Rule1 tab.) For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point. Answer: Explanation: Box 1: Yes A Basic Load Balancer supports virtual machines in a single availability set or virtual machine scale set. Box 2: Yes When using load-balancing rules with Azure Load Balancer, you need to specify health probes to allow Load Balancer to detect the backend endpoint status. The configuration of the health probe and probe responses determine which backend pool instances will receive new flows. You can use health probes to detect the failure of an application on a backend endpoint. You can also generate a custom response to a health probe and use the health probe for flow control to manage load or planned downtime. When a health probe fails, Load Balancer will stop sending new flows to the respective unhealthy instance. Outbound connectivity is not impacted, only inbound connectivity is impacted.

You need to join the virtual machine to an Active Directory domain. How should you complete the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Bach correct selection is worth one point. Answer: Explanation: Azure Resource Manager template overview Resource Manager templates let you define Azure infrastructure in code. The required resources, network connections, or configuration of VMs can all be defined in a template. These templates create consistent, reproducible deployments each time, and can be versioned as you make changes. For more information, see Azure Resource Manager templates overview. Each resource is defined in a template using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). The following JSON example uses the Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/extensions resource type to install the Active Directory domain join extension. Parameters are used that you specify at deployment time. When the extension is deployed, the VM is joined to the specified managed domain. JSON { \"apiVersion\": \"2015-06-15\", \"type\": \"Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/extensions\", \"name\": \"[concat(parameters('dnsLabelPrefix'),'/joindomain')]\", \"location\": \"[parameters('location')]\", \"dependsOn\": [ \"[concat('Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/', parameters('dnsLabelPrefix'))]\" ], \"properties\": { \"publisher\": \"Microsoft.Compute\", \"type\": \"JsonADDomainExtension\", \"typeHandlerVersion\": \"1.3\", \"autoUpgradeMinorVersion\": true, \"settings\": { \"Name\": \"[parameters('domainToJoin')]\", \"OUPath\": \"[parameters('ouPath')]\", \"User\": \"[concat(parameters('domainToJoin'), '\\\\', parameters('domainUsername'))]\", \"Restart\": \"true\", \"Options\": \"[parameters('domainJoinOptions')]\" }, \"protectedSettings\": { \"Password\": \"[parameters('domainPassword')]\" } } } This VM extension can be deployed even if you don't create a VM in the same template. The examples in this article show both of the following approaches: Create a Windows Server VM and join to a managed domain Join an existing Windows Server VM to a managed domain QUESTION 552 Hotspot Question You have two Azure virtual machines as shown in the following table.

    "question": "Your company has an Azure subscription and has setup the following Virtual Networks and subnets in Azure: The following Virtual Machines have been deployed in the subnets: You now need to add an application gateway to the Virtual Network lead2pass-net1. Which of the following would you do first?",

    "explanation": "When you deploy an application gateway to a Virtual Network, it needs to have an empty subnet to deploy the application gateway resources. As an example shown below, a Virtual Machine exists in a subnet in the Virtual Network lead2pass-net. This is why we can't use this Network to deploy the application gateway. So, in our question, the only way to deploy the application gateway is to first stop the virtual machines and deallocate them. This seems to be the most suitable answers from the options given. The other options provided would not assist in the creation of the gateway. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/quick-create-portal",
